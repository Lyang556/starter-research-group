Li Guotian, professor and doctoral supervisor of Huazhong Agricultural University. He has been engaged in the research of rice blast interaction for a long time. He has established a rice fast neutron mutant library with whole genome sequencing, and analyzed the mutation deeply by using a variety of bioinformatics methods. He has proved that using this mutant library can quickly clone rice disease resistance related genes, and clarified the role of Magnaporthe grisea mst50 protein in multiple MAPK signaling pathways. He has published more than 10 research papers in plant cell, molecular plant, environmental microbiology, current opinion in microbiology, rice and other academic journals.
